# MiSTer Updater script for PC (Windows and Linux)
Download [*updater-pc.zip*](https://github.com/theypsilon/Update_All_MiSTer/blob/master/updater-pc/updater-pc.zip?raw=true) and extract the contents on an **EMPTY** folder. Access the new *updater-pc* folder. On Windows execute *update_all_win.bat* or *update_all_win_db9_encc.bat", on Linux execute *update_all_linux.sh*.

Any configuration file should be placed at *updater-pc/update_all.ini* before you execute anything. (optional)

After the updater is done, copy all the contents of that folder to your MiSTer SD card.

Next time you can execute the same script from the MiSTer SD card directly*.

Windows binaries licenses are under *licenses* directory in the zip file.

*Some cards might have issues with downloading many files to it at once, so it is better to run from the SD card for incremental updates only.
